/**
 * Revisions log for Ubercart PayPal Buttons module
 */

version 2009/06/16 (release 6.x-1.0)
-- ported 5.x-1.0 version to Drupal 6/Ubercart 2, removed integration
  with the uc_subscribe module (not available for D6/U2), and
  replaced support for Workflow-ng with Rules

version 2009/04/24 (release 5.x-1.0)
-- first release of uc_paypal_buttons on drupal.org
-- added option for requiring that the user is logged in/registered
  before checking out with PayPal (thanks to todda00)
-- changed default return URL for successful payment or cancellation
  to $base_url to fix a bug (thanks to todda00)
-- fixed handling of free (zero amount/no payment) trial periods
  for subscriptions (thanks to catch)
-- PayPal Subscription IDs are recorded as order comments
  when a sign-up IPN is received
-- added product feature option for Buy Now items of whether
  to include the note field on the PayPal confirmation page
-- added validation for any PayPal Buttons IPNs to ensure that
  purchase data returns (with the IPN) as it was sent by the
  initial redirection
-- added Workflow-ng events for when a Buy Now item is purchased,
  and when a Subscription item is registered, renewed, or expires,
  and also for subscription cancellation, failure, and modification
-- added verification that Ubercart PayPal module is configured 
  properly (PayPal server and e-mail are set)
-- added currency sign prefix to monetary fields on settings pages
-- merged changes in uc_paypal.module (from Ubercart version 5.x-1.7)
  to uc_paypal_buttons_ipn 
-- uc_subscribe integration and other post-payment handling is now
  invoked after uc_cart_complete_sale
-- uc_paypal_buttons does not need to create users, because 
  uc_cart_complete_sale does this when the order is for an anonymous
  user and no existing user matches the order's primary e-mail address
-- removed check in uc_paypal_buttons_ipn for a duplicate txn_id 
  because subscriptions use the same txn_id for payments
-- improved compliance with Drupal coding standards

version 2008/04/11
-- first release of uc_paypal_buttons on ubercart.org
